# university-projects
I am currently a student at Babes-Bolyai University from Cluj-Napoca in Computer Science teached in english, class of 2028.
These are the projects I did and projects that I will do during my university path, I am posting this for future/current students so they know what they are signing up for
and maybe lend a hand when they need it the most.
It also helps me keep track of my projects and track my progress through university and learning different and new things.


If you are from the university staff and this breaks any terms & conditions or any rules, please contact me through my student e-mail or through MS Teams: rares.moldovan2@stud.ubbcluj.ro
